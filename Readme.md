# USARm : A 3D printed borescope arm for urban search and rescue

This was a final year project as part of the Applied Physics course at St Mary's University, Twickenham. The project comprised the design and characterization of a modular 3D printed continuum arm and was based on earlier work by a team at King's College London.
